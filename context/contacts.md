### Important Update

The business rules around contacts in Xero may be changing in the future and 'Contact Name' may no longer be a unique field.

_We recommend all developers use ContactID to uniquely reference contacts in Xero and do not rely on ContactName as a way to reference contact data uniquely in Xero._

### Optional parameters for GET Contacts

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Record filter** | You can specify an individual record by appending the value to the endpoint, i.e. `GET https://.../Contacts/{identifier}`<br>* * *<br>**ContactID** – The Xero identifier for a contact e.g. 297c2dc5-cc47-4afd-8ec8-74990b8761e9<br>* * *<br>**ContactNumber** – A custom identifier specified from another system e.g. a CRM system has a contact number of CUST100 |
| Modified After | The ModifiedAfter filter is actually an HTTP header: ' **If-Modified-Since**'. A UTC timestamp (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss) . Only contacts created or modified since this timestamp will be returned e.g. 2009-11-12T00:00:00 **Note:** changes to the Balances, IsCustomer or IsSupplier values will not trigger a contact to be returned with the Modified-After filter |
| IDs | Filter by a comma-separated list of ContactIDs. Allows you to retrieve a specific set of contacts in a single call. See [details.](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api/accounting/contacts#optimised-use-of-the-where-filter) |
| Where | Filter using the _where_ parameter. We recommend you limit filtering to the [optimised elements](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api/accounting/contacts#optimised-use-of-the-where-filter) only. |
| order | Order by any element returned ( _see [Order By](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api/accounting/requests-and-responses/#retrieving-a-smaller-lightweight-response-using-the-summaryonly-parameter)_ ) |
| page | Up to 100 contacts will be returned per call when the page parameter is used e.g. page=1 |
| includeArchived | e.g. includeArchived=true – Contacts with a status of ARCHIVED will be included in the response |
| summaryOnly | When set to true, this returns lightweight fields, excluding computation-heavy fields from the response, making the API calls quick and efficient. More details [here.](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api/accounting/contacts/#retrieving-a-smaller-lightweight-response-using-the-summaryonly-parameter) |
| searchTerm | Search parameter that performs a case-insensitive text search across the fields: Name, FirstName, LastName, ContactNumber, CompanyNumber, EmailAddress. |

### High volume threshold limit

In order to make our platform more stable, we've added a high volume threshold limit for the GET Contacts Endpoint.

- Requests that have more than 100k contacts being returned in the response will be denied
- Requests using unoptimised fields for filtering or ordering that result in more than 100k contacts will be denied with a 400 response code

Please continue reading to find out how you can use paging and optimise your filtering to ensure your requests are always successful. Be sure to check out the [Efficient Data Retrieval](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api/efficient-data-retrieval) page for tips on query optimisation.

### Paging contacts (recommended)

By using paging all the elements in each individual contact are returned in the response which avoids the need to retrieve each individual contact to get all the details (GET Contacts without paging only returns a subset of elements)

More information about [retrieving paged resources](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api/accounting/requests-and-responses#retrieving-paged-resources).

### Optimised use of the where filter

The most common filters have been optimised to ensure performance across organisations of all sizes. We recommend you restrict your filtering to the following optimised parameters. These parameters are case- and accent-insensitive and should not be appended with `ToLower()` or `ToUpper()`.

_When using individually or combined with the AND operator:_

| Field | Operator | Query |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | equals | where=Name="ABC limited" |
| EmailAddress | equals | where=EmailAddress=" [email@example.com](mailto:email@example.com)" |
| AccountNumber | equals | where=AccountNumber="ABC-100" |

### Optimised filtering on a list of values

The IDs query parameter allows you to filter based on a list of ContactIDs:

| field | query parameter |
| --- | --- |
| IDs | ?IDs=220ddca8-3144-4085-9a88-2d72c5133734,88192a99-cbc5-4a66-bf1a-2f9fea2d36d0 |

### Optimised ordering:

The following parameters are optimised for ordering:

- ContactID
- UpdatedDateUTC
- Name

The default order is _UpdatedDateUTC ASC, ContactID ASC_. Secondary ordering is applied by default using the ContactID. This ensures consistency across pages.

### Avoid unoptimised filtering:

For large organisations, unoptimised queries can result in request rejections and hitting system thresholds. The following examples of unoptimised queries are quite common, but there are more efficient alternatives available.

**Example 1:** Retrieve all contacts with specific text in the contact name

Unoptimised queries:

```json
Contacts?where=Name.Contains("Peter")
Contacts?where=Name.StartsWith("P")
Contacts?where=Name.EndsWith("r")
```

copy code

Optimised query:

```json
Contacts?SearchTerm=peter
Contacts?SearchTerm=p
Contacts?SearchTerm=r

```

copy code

**Example 2:** Retrieve all contacts whose email address starts with specific text

Unoptimised query:

```json
EmailAddress!=null&&EmailAddress.StartsWith("boom")
```

copy code

Optimised query:

```json
Contacts?SearchTerm=boom
```

copy code

For both examples, using an exact match on the `Name` or `EmailAddress` field with the `=` operator will have the best performance.

### Retrieving a smaller lightweight response using the 'summaryOnly' parameter

Use _summaryOnly=true_ in GET Contacts endpoint to retrieve a smaller version of the response object. This returns only lightweight fields, excluding computation-heavy fields from the response, making the API calls quick and efficient. The following fields will be **excluded** from the response:

- Addresses
- Balances
- ContactGroups
- ContactPersons
- IsCustomer
- IsSupplier
- PurchasesDefaultAccountCode
- PurchasesTrackingCategories
- SalesDefaultAccountCode
- SalesTrackingCategories

```json
https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/contacts?summaryOnly=True
```

copy code

The _summaryOnly_ parameter works with other filters, but not when filtering on the excluded fields. And when this parameter is used, pagination is enforced by default.

## CIS Settings (UK)

[anchor for cis settings uk](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api/accounting/contacts#cis-settings-uk)

If you are a UK organisation or contractor registered under Construction Industry Scheme, you can retrieve CIS settings for your contacts to identify if it is a CIS subcontractor and also get the CIS deduction rate.

If the contact has never been enabled as a CIS subcontractor then this endpoint will return a 404.

The following is returned for the CIS settings of a contact

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CISEnabled | true or false – Boolean that describes if the contact is a CIS Subcontractor |
| Rate | CIS Deduction rate for the contact if he is a subcontractor. If the contact is not CISEnabled, then the rate is not returned |

  "CISSettings": [\
    {\
      "CISEnabled": true,\
      "Rate": 20\

### Uploading an Attachment

You can upload up to 10 attachments (each up to 25mb in size) per contact, once the contact has been created in Xero. To do this you'll need to know the ID of the contact which you'll use to construct the URL when POST/PUTing a byte stream containing the attachment file. e.g. [https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Contacts/](https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Contacts/) _f0ec0d8c-6fce-4330-bb3b-8306278c6fd8_/Attachments/ _image.png_. See the [Attachments](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api/accounting/attachments) page for more details.

Example of uploading an attachment to a contact

```json
POST https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Contacts/f0ec0d8c-4330-bb3b-83062c6fd8/Attachments/Image002932.png

## PUT Contacts

[anchor for put contacts](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api/accounting/contacts#put-contacts)

Use this method to create one or more contact records. This method works very similar to POST Contacts but if an existing contact matches your ContactName or ContactNumber then you will receive an error.

## Webhooks

[anchor for webhooks](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api/accounting/contacts#webhooks)

You can create a subscription to get contact events. Create and update events are available (incuding when contacts are archived). See the [Webhooks](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/webhooks/overview) page for more details.

### Retrieving History

View a summary of the actions made by all users to the contact. See the [History and Notes](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api/accounting/historyandnotes/) page for more details.

Example of retrieving a contact's history

```json
GET https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Contacts/{Guid}/History

  "HistoryRecords": [\
     {\
      "Changes": "Updated",\
      "DateUTCString": "2018-02-28T21:02:11",\
      "DateUTC": "\/Date(1519851731990+0000)\/",\
      "User": "System Generated",\
      "Details": "Received through the Xero API from ABC Org"\
    },\
    {\
      "Changes": "Created",\
      "DateUTCString": "2018-02-28T21:01:29",\
      "DateUTC": "\/Date(1519851689297+0000)\/",\
